		<p> This assignment was a top ten list that was meant to be persuasive
			for the audience  of your choosing which I completed for IDS 129. <br> Take Care- Drake<br>
Started the rise of Drake to the top of Hip-hop.
Drake has gone on a legendary run in the 2010s<br>

The Carter 4- Lil Wayne<br>
Arguably one of the best Lil Wayne albums.
Created new age sound with the production on this album<br>

Good kid, M.A.A.D. City- Kendrick Lamar<br>
Launched Kendrick Lamar into the mainstream.
Started his legendary run in the 2010s making him one of the greatest of all time.<br>

2014 Forest Hills Drive- J.Cole<br>
After this album, J.Cole was seen as one of the best lyricists/rappers of our generation.<br>
DS2- Future
Arguably the pinnacle of the Atlanta trap sound.
Eventually this style of trap music became mainstream and this album is where Future perfected it.<br>

What a Time to Be Alive- Drake and Future<br>
Two hip hop juggernauts drop a collaboration album it is bound to be legendary.
Their styles of rap fit perfectly with each other and they both played a major role in bringing rap into the mainstream.<br>

Astroworld- Travis Scott<br>
The long-awaited and massively anticipated album did not let any Travis Scott fans down.<br>

Culture- Migos<br>
Their wild and arrogant personalities in their music is enjoyable for some to listen to and they have an upbeat feel to it.
