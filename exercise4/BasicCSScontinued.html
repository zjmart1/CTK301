      <p class="textright">The Toyota Camry has gone from a fantastic family
        sedan to anonymous four-door and now back to its former glory.
        That's right. The Toyota is once again a truly desirable option in a
        segment that's slumping but still highly competitive.</p>
      <p class="textcenter"> Despite its mainstream brand name, the 2021 Kia Stinger offers the
        performance, features, and desirability to go up against the German
        sports-sedan status quo. This four-door cleverly disguises its hatchback
         and large trunk with a layout similar to that of the sleek Audi A5 Sportback
         and BMW 4-series Gran Coupe.</p>
      <p class="textjustify"> The Sonata N Line will be hard to pick out from
        a regular Sonata at a distance. Its styling cues are subtle and easy to
        miss at a glance. It boasts larger 19-inch wheels set atop larger brakes
       for added stopping power, quad exhaust tips, slightly tweaked front and
        rear fascias, a lip spoiler, and small N badges located on the front
        fenders and grille.</p>
      <p class="textspace"> Volkswagen gives the 2021 Arteon fresh exterior
        details and various interior updates. The former includes new front
        bumpers, new wheel designs, the adoption of the company's new logo,
        and more differentiation for the sporty R-Line.</p>
      <p class="textheight"> The 2021 Ford Bronco Sport is the baby brother of
        the all-new, off-road-ready Bronco SUV, and a viable alternative to
        Jeep's smaller models.</p>
